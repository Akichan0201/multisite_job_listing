##Scrape multi-site job listing
well hello thereðŸ‘‹. So today i'm gonna show you the next project. so what todo is i have to scrape from multi-site for job, like from linkedIn, Jobstreet, Glints,and other site.
because there is so many list of jobs, so i'm gonna get 5000+ data of listing. because there is so many ways to scrape i'm gonna use Python cause it much easier to learn than other language
(for me).

i will separate it into some different files for each link and function so we don't have to 

### What to do?
in here i will use 2 modules for scrape cause we didn't know which one can be more effective to scrape. But
